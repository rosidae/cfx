credits to [Lei Fu](https://github.com/imfl/color-console) for making color.h

# starting out

please visit [starting out help](https://github.com/rosidae/cfx/wiki/starting-out)

# please read:

all examples in the wiki should be 100% reproducable in the Windows Terminal application off of the Microsoft store using `g++ -o test test.cpp -I".\include\"` with MinGW and with a monospaced font (i am using Source Code Pro (normal font weight)) and in powershell

do not expect this side-project of mine to be optomized, maintained, or well documented

this is just a side-project of mine that i started for fun and to get more comfortable with c++

i am a beginner to c++ too so i do not know much

i will not be held accountable to fix your problems (but i will try my hardest to)
